This repository holds the programming assignments files from ecs 170. 

[1st Assignment](https://github.com/abiliooliveira/ecs170/tree/master/1stAssignment):

Given an arbitrary 3-dimensional map, a start point and an end point, how to efficiently get from one place to another? This assignment is a Java implementation of this famous AI problem to exercise **Search**. The *A-star* algorithm is here implemented.

[2nd Assignment](https://github.com/abiliooliveira/ecs170/tree/master/2ndAssignment):


**Reasoning** is exercised in this assignment. It consists of a *ConnectFour* AI player Java implementation using two different techniques: *Minmax* and *Alpha-beta prunning*.

[3rd Assignment](https://github.com/abiliooliveira/ecs170/tree/master/3rdAssignment):

Given a human face picture, is it possible to create an algorithm that decides if the face is man's or woman's? In this assignment a Neural Network is implemented in Java that decides, with some accuracy percentage, if an encoded face picture is from a male or female character. Here we exercise the third pillar of AI: **Learning**

# usage

You are not authorized to use this project for your coursework if you are at UC Davis or any other school with similar assignments.
If you want to learn anything about arcaic Artificial Neural Networks, the best way is to sitdown, read and implement things yourself.
In other words, do not copy other people's work. You would only be hurting your future self.
